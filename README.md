# CS521-Debunking-Solana

## Project Description:
We will walk over the Solana code, explaining the four most important aspects: <br />
Accounts & State: How Solana Handles Data <br />
Consensus: Tower BFT and Proof of History <br />
Fee Calculation and Rent <br />
Validator Lifecycle & Voting <br /> <br />

We will also look into the possible implementation of ALH (Accounts Lattice Hash) instead of ADH (Accounts Delta Hash) in Solana and its limitations. <br /> <br />
